# Small tool chain used at work

Includes:
- Autosave ( emulating CTRL - S ) to foreground app every X minutes ( Minutes defined in settings configuration ).
- Eye Strain, follows the 20 20 20 rule ( every 20 minutes, take a break for 20 seconds and look at something 20 feet away ).
- Water reminder, every 30 minutes reminds you to drink some water to keep hydrated.

Has english and greek options looking to expand a bit in the future

Settings are saved on a config file, sample is provided, and are manipulated through a text editor ( notepad, VsC or any really ). The sample file also contains instructions on how it works.

# Uses
tKinter, which sadly only works on Windows ( most workstations are using windows in an office enviroment ), im looking for a way to make it work on Linux as well.

pynput, to emulate the CTRL - S keypress, should only work on windows looking for Linux alternative

time, for obvious reasons

# Why
A coworker lost 40 minutes of work with his InDesign crashed and threw the idea of a save reminder, so i got to work. I was also bored.

# Future
Any new idea as for a tool will be added, if you have an idea create an issue or contact me a here: christian@blanksoft.eu
